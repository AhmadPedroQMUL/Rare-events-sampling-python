# Rare-events-sampling-python
Python implementation of the Uniform sampling algorithm package, seeks to utilise this package for exploratory simulations of models of polymers to elucidate further how uniform sampling improves algorithm performance. Building on last yearâ€™s research internship done by Kane Kelser (https://github.com/Kane-Kesler?tab=repositories).
